# Rootfinders for complex analytic functions

This repo contains codes in Fortran 77 accompanying the manuscript:

H. Zhang, and V. Rokhlin, "Finding roots of complex analytic functions via generalized colleague matrices." Advances in Computational Mathematics 50.4 (2024): 71.

It includes subroutines for finding zeros of complex analytic functions on a square.
The main programs are `comrootsq.f` and `comrootadapsq.f` for the nonadaptive and adaptive version respectively.

Run the bash script `comrootsq` and `comrootadapsq` to excute the program.
